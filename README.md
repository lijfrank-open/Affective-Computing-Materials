# Affective Computing Materials
This repository compiles materials related to affective computing, currently featuring two main parts: one recommends top-tier journals and conferences in the field, and the other provides an overview of papers related to various tasks within the domain.

## Journal and Conference in Affective Computing
Here is a list (top-tier) of recommended journals and conferences in the field of affective computing, covering natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal learning (MML), physiological signals.

### Tailored Journal and Conference
- Journal: TAFFC (CAAI-A), a top-tier journal in the field
- Conference: ACII, a top-tier conference, but with limited recognition

### NLP-oriented Affective Computing
- Journal: TASLP, TACL (CAAI-B)
- Conference: ACL, EMNLP, NAACL (CAAI-B), SIGKDD, SIGIR, WWW

Note: For NLP research, TACL and NAACL are often considered the top-tier journal and conference.

### CV-oriented Affective Computing
- Journal: TIP, IJCV, TPAMI
- Conference: ECCV, CVPR, ICCV

### Multimodal Affective Computing
- Journal: TMM, INFFUS
- Conference: ACM MM

Note: For multimodal research, journals and conferences in NLP and CV can also be considered.

### General Journal and Conference
- Journal: TNNLS, TCYB, TOIS, SCIS, TOCHI, IJHCS
- Conference: AAAI, IJCAI, CHI

Despite the abundance of journals and conferences can be selected in the field of affective computing, there are still very few papers on this field in many journals and conferences such as TOCHI, IJHCS, and CHI. Affective computing researchers are mainly divided into two camps: NLP and CV, and they tend to publish their papers in journals and conferences related to their respective fields. The NLP field focuses on sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, and emotion response; the CV field focuses on facial expression recognition and generation. It is worth noting that most multimodal affective computing research is led by NLP researchers.

Additionally, there are researchers focusing on affective computing based on physiological signals. 

### Physiological Signal-oriented Affective Computing
- Journal: TNNLS, TCYB, TOIS, SCIS, TOCHI, IJHCS
- Conference: AAAI, IJCAI, CHI
- Journal: TMM, INFFUS
- Conference: ACM MM

Note: For physiological signal research, journals and conferences are the same as the general ones. For multimodal physiological signals, TMM, INFFUS, ACM MM can also be considered.

Of course, in addition to top-tier journals and conferences, there are also other journals and conferences to consider.

### NLP-oriented Affective Computing
- Journal: CL, Speech Communication, TALLIP, TKDD, IPM, KAIS, KBS, TWEB
- Conference: COLING, INTERSPEECH, ICASSP, CIKM, ICDM, ECMLPKDD

### CV-oriented Affective Computing
- Journal: CVIU, TCI, PR, TCSVT
- Conference: ICPR, WACV

### Multimodal Affective Computing
- Journal: TOMM
- Conference: ICME

Note: For multimodal research, journals and conferences in NLP and CV can also be considered.

### General Journal and Conference
- Journal: FCS, TAI, JAIR, TIST, IJNS, NEUNET, NEUCOM, HCI, THMS, IwC, IJHCI
- Conference: ECAI, AISTATS, IUI

### Physiological Signal-oriented Affective Computing
- Journal: Brain, Behavior, and Immunity (YBRBI), TNSRE, BBS
- Conference: BIBM, EMBC, CogSci
- Journal: FCS, TAI, JAIR, TIST, IJNS, NEUNET, NEUCOM, HCI, THMS, IwC, IJHCI
- Conference: ECAI, AISTATS, IUI
- Journal: TOMM
- Conference: ICME

Note: For multimodal physiological signals, TOMM, ICME can also be considered.
