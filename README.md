# Affective Computing Materials

## Journals and Conferences in Affective Computing
Here is a list (top-tier) of recommended journals and conferences in the field of affective computing, covering natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal learning (MML), physiological signals.

### Tailored Journals and Conferences
- Journal: TAFFC (CAAI-A), a top-tier journal in the field
- Conference: ACII, a top-tier conference, but with limited recognition

### NLP-oriented Affective Computing
- Journals: TASLP, TACL (CAAI-B), TKDE
- Conferences: ACL, EMNLP, NAACL (CAAI-B), SIGKDD, SIGMOD, ICDE, SIGIR, WWW

**Note**: For NLP research, TACL and NAACL are often considered the top journal and conference

### CV-oriented Affective Computing
- Journals: TIP, IJCV, TPAMI
- Conferences: ECCV, CVPR, ICCV

### Multimodal Affective Computing
- Journals: TMM, Information Fusion
- Conference: ACM MM

**Note**: For multimodal research, consider journals and conferences in NLP and CV fields as well

### General Journals and Conferences
- Journals: TNNLS, TYCB, TOIS, SCIS, TOCHI, IJHCS
- Conferences: AAAI, IJCAI, CHI

Although there are many journals and conferences to choose from in the field of affective computing, the number of papers in this area is still relatively low, such as TOCHI, IJHCS, CHI, etc. Affective computing researchers are mainly divided into two camps: NLP and CV, and they tend to publish their papers in journals and conferences related to their respective fields. The NLP field focuses on (multimodal) sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, and emotion response; the CV field focuses on facial expression recognition and generation. It is worth noting that most multimodal affective computing research is led by NLP researchers.

Additionally, there are researchers focusing on affective computing based on physiological signals. 

### Physiological Signal-oriented Affective Computing
Journals and conferences are the same as the general field, such as TNNLS, TYCB, TOIS, SCIS, TOCHI, IJHCS, AAAI, IJCAI, CHI. For multimodal physiological signals, consider TMM, Information Fusion, ACM MM as well.
